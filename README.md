- Retrieves background images from a local directory
- Uses PIL to compose images with centered quotes
- Handles multi-line quotes to ensure they fit within the image
- Supports customization of fonts and font sizes
- Displays the quote and author on the image
- Provides an option for users to request removal of copyrighted content
